<span style="font-weight: 400;">DNA, also known as Deoxyribonucleotide, consists of genes that, if we encode, can provide us with information that can never be discovered through any other measure. Genes are present in every characteristic of the Human body. These genes are present in specific sequences that can be decoded to obtain information about ourselves. Gene studies can help a person know his heritage and his ancestral background. It can tell us from which part of the world we actually belong. Moreover, gene studies can help us know our long-lost relatives.</span>
